A mechanical engineer by training and a data scientist by practice. Over the past 4 years, Dr Hantouche has been working as a data science and machine learning professional within both academic and instruial 


Hello, I'm Mireille Hantouche, a self-taught Data Scientist passionate about discovering hidden patterns and insights in data to solve complex problems and drive informed decisions. I am a native of Lebanon, and have a background in Mechanical Engineering; in which I hold a Bachelor, Masters and PhD degrees. After completing my doctoral studies, I continued working in academia for another three years as a postdoctoral fellow. After accepting my first consultancy

Key Aspects of a Data Scientist's Passion
Problem-Solving:
Data scientists are fundamentally problem solvers who use data to understand the world and explain phenomena. They are passionate about tackling complex business and scientific challenges. 
Discovery and Insight:
They enjoy the detective-like work of uncovering hidden patterns, trends, and insights that others might miss. 
Technical Innovation:
A passion for adapting to new technologies like AI and machine learning is crucial, asthey are the tools used to build predictive models and analyze data. 
Broad Applications:
The diverse applications of data science across various industries—from healthcare to finance—are a significant source of passion, offering endless opportunities to learn about different domains. 
Learning and Experimentation:
Data scientists are continuously learning about new algorithms and improving their skills. They also enjoy experimenting with personal data projects to apply their knowledge. 
Communication and Collaboration:
A significant part of their motivation is the ability to communicate complex findings clearly to stakeholders and collaborate with inspiring colleagues from different backgrounds. 
Impact:
The ability to guide better future decisions and implement impactful changes based on data-driven insights is a strong motivator.



couple of years ago I took my first consultancy assignmnet and that's when I realized my passion for data and everything that Six months into my graduation - out of pure interest, I quit my Engineering job and made a conscious decision of moving into design, an enterprise which has led me to adopt it as a full time career and develop my skills in UX and visual design. During the past 7+ years of working in diverse industries including education, health, media, SaaS and non-profits, with environments ranging from tiny startups to Fortune 500 companies, I have exposed myself to various challenges involving user experience and visual design. My designs have been instrumental in raising a $14 million funding for a healthcare startup, and products being used by millions across the planet.

To me, design is a problem solving activity. As a designer, I understand that the perfect design not only involves visual aesthetics, but even more importantly, an interface that functions well. This requires a deep understanding of human behavior and psychology - the outcome of which greatly impacts the overall experience of the product, regardless of the platform. 

I personally enjoy working on projects that require both strategy as well as visual design. I love working on problems from the ideation stage and seeing them through completion through pixel-perfect designs. I dream to become a domain expert in my field with being able to move among the process from user research to designing to shipping and analyzing results.
